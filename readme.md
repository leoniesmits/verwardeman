# Verwarde Man

A school assignment where I had to make a webpage fitting to a story about a confused man. This only exists of images, css and HTML. The inspiration for the design was Jean Michel Basquiat. 

## The Story

The story comes from a series called _stijloefeningen_ by author [Molovich](http://nurksmagazine.nl/author/molovich/).

The story can be found [here](http://nurksmagazine.nl/2011/06/stijloefeningen-84-de-verwarde-man/).

## The Assignment

This assignment was part of _Project Web_ in the first semester of my second year. I liked the assignment, as visual design, user experience and development all came together. This is the design I liked most and thus displayed right here.
